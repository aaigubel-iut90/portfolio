    <p class="text">As a leading industry player, Orange wants to contribute to building a more responsible digital world. Orange has committed to being net zero carbon by 2040. This involves significant efforts to reduce direct and indirect CO2 emissions: energy efficiency, renewable energy, circular economy, decarbonizing our value chain, and carbon capture. This also includes financing carbon sink projects to capture residual emissions. A voluntary roadmap with initial results expected by 2025.

    <h1 style="align-self: flex-start; margin-left: 20px;" id="section1">Ecology within Orange</h1>

    <p>Orange and respect for the environment: a long-term commitment<br>Through this first initiative, Orange, staying true to its mission, aims to provide its customers with an understanding of the impact of their digital usage. Above all, the group also seeks to equip them with the means to act, offering tips and advice.</p><br>
    <p>Orange is also the first operator to launch such an initiative in the use of its services. This approach will be enhanced in the coming months.</p><br>
    <p>The goal? Achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 by first reducing all CO2 emissions by at least 30% by 2025. Adapting to the IPCC’s recommendations and the Paris Agreement is a priority for Orange. This also aligns with Orange's commitment to implementing more responsible procurement circuits, offering eco-designed products, and second-hand network equipment. Pre-owned terminals will also be sold directly in stores.</p><br>
    <p>The circular economy will therefore be prioritized to achieve the net zero carbon goal. Orange understands that the fight against climate change is crucial. This issue should no longer be up for debate in 2020, as it is a decisive battle for the future of our planet, one in which we must collectively mobilize.</p>

        <h1 style="align-self: flex-start; margin-left: 20px;" id="section2">Fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions</h1><br>

        <p>Orange is committed to reducing CO2 equivalent emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3 to achieve net zero carbon by 2040. A first milestone is set for 2025 with a 30% reduction in scopes 1 and 2 emissions compared to 2015, and a 14% reduction in scope 3 emissions compared to 2018.</p><br>
        <p>The company sets a second milestone for 2030 with a 45% reduction in emissions across all scopes compared to 2020.</p>
       <p>Through this commitment, Orange is doing its part in the global effort defined by the "Paris Agreement" during COP 21 on December 12, 2015.</p><br>
        <p>Its primary goal is to keep “the increase in global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and to pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” In recent years, world leaders have emphasized the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century.</p><br>
